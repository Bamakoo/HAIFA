# Project HAIFA

## A recipe app to rule'em all 

### About the Project 

This Project was built by [Emma GAUBERT](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emma-gaubert/). 
Two goals were pursued with this project :

- Improve author's knowledge of Combine (all network calls are performed using this framework).
- Learn a little bit of UIKit (the User's profile is built using UIKit).
